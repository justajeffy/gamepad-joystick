# 3D-Printable Replacement Gravis GamePad Joystick

So you have a Gravis GamePad! Very cool. But you're missing the joystick
like everyone else. Maybe you've got an old 8/32" bolt screwed in that you
use instead, which is nearly as uncomfortable as the original stick.

But now, there's a solution!

The original joystick has plastic threads which screw into the gamepad, but
these would be quite fragile if 3D printed. Instead, there's a 0.6" deep hole
in the model where you glue in a 0.75" length of threaded 8-32 rod. Or just
get an 8-32 screw and cut the head off. It should protrude 0.15" below the
bottom of the joystick handle.

Enjoy!
